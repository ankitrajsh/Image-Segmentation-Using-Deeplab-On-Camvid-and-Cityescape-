## Datasets  

### CamVid  
The **CamVid** dataset is a collection of video sequences that have been annotated for semantic segmentation tasks. It contains images captured from driving scenarios, with pixel-level annotations for various object classes such as roads, pedestrians, vehicles, and buildings. The dataset is widely used for evaluating segmentation algorithms due to its diverse scenes and detailed annotations.  

- **Number of Images**: Approximately 700 images  
- **Classes**: 11 classes including road, sidewalk, building, tree, car, and person.  
- **Usage**: Ideal for training and validating segmentation models in urban environments.

### Cityscapes  
The **Cityscapes** dataset is designed for semantic urban scene understanding. It consists of high-resolution images taken from various cities, annotated with pixel-level labels for a wide range of classes. The dataset focuses on the challenges of urban environments, making it suitable for training advanced segmentation models.  

- **Number of Images**: 5,000 images (with 2,975 finely annotated)  
- **Classes**: 30 classes including road, sidewalk, building, car, person, and traffic signs.  
- **Usage**: Commonly used for benchmarking segmentation models due to its high-quality annotations and diverse urban scenes.
